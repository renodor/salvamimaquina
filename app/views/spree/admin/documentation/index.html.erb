    <h2>Products</h2>
    <p>All products are synchronized from Salva Mi MÃ¡quina RepairShopr account and <b>shouldn't be modified from the website admin.</b> Things like product details, images, variants, prices, stock, product categories (taxonomies) etc shouldn't be touched at all on website admin and are all synchronized directly from RepairShopr. The only product related features that have to be handle in website admin are:</p>

    <h3 id="products-discount">Products Discount</h3>
    <p>On RepairShopr we can't create a discount for a specific product. So this can be done on the website admin</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Go to <%= link_to 'admin > products', admin_products_path, target: :blank %> and select the product you want to discount</li>
      <li>Click on the <b>"Sale Prices"</b> tab</li>
      <li>Select the variant you want to discount and click on the <b>"New Sale Price"</b> button</li>
      <li>Type the discount price, select a start and end date (optional), and click on <b>"Create"</b>. If you don't select start and end date, the discount will always be active. If you select a start date in the future, the discount will be programmed to only start at this date. (Like that you can program discount to start and end whenever you want)</li>
      <li>If a product has an active discount, you will see the discount price (and the normal price crossed) on the product page</li>
    </ol>
